Book Listing App Project
=========================

The application takes in a user input and queries the Google Books API with the user input and gets a list of published books 
based on the user's search query. The UI is managed in two different screens. The splash screen presents a search page, 
similar to the Google search page and a search results screen with a list of books presented as cards with the following 
details:
* Title of the Book
* Author(s) of the book
* Average rating of the book (five stars max)
* Sale price of the book (in USD)
